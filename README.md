Retail Sales Analysis – SQL Project
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a retail sales dataset using SQL to uncover business insights, detect patterns, and support data-driven decisions. The aim is to perform data cleaning, exploration, and deep analysis to answer key business questions related to customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

🎯 Objectives
Clean raw transactional data for consistency and accuracy.

Explore and summarize the sales data to identify patterns.

Answer real-world business questions using advanced SQL queries.

Demonstrate SQL proficiency across data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
PostgreSQL using pgAdmin 4

SQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and analysis

Structured Query Language (SQL) concepts:

CREATE TABLE, SELECT, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, JOIN, CTE, RANK, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, and AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

🧹 Step 1: Data Preparation
Created a table retail_sales with relevant fields (transactions, customers, product info, prices, etc.).

Identified and removed records with NULL values in critical columns using DELETE.

Checked data types and ensured consistency for further analysis.

🔍 Step 2: Data Exploration
Determined the total number of transactions and unique customers.

Extracted distinct product categories for segmentation.

Analyzed missing values before deleting records to maintain data quality.

📊 Step 3: Business Questions & SQL Analysis
A total of 12 real-world business questions were answered using optimized SQL queries, including:

Fetching transactions on a specific date.

Filtering sales by category, quantity, and month.

Calculating total and average sales per category and month.

Identifying top-performing months and top 5 customers.

Segmenting transactions by time-based shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).

Aggregating customer demographics (e.g., average age).

Counting unique customers per category.

Finding daily sales volume and high-value transactions.

Ranking months by performance using window functions.

Using HAVING to filter groups (e.g., days with >5 transactions).

✅ Final Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience with SQL for real-world business analytics.

Applied data wrangling, aggregation, and window functions to support decision-making.

Delivered clean, structured, and well-analyzed results that can support sales strategy and customer insights.
