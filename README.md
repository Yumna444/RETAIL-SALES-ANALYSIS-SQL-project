Retail Sales Analysis – SQL Project

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a retail sales dataset using SQL to uncover business insights, detect patterns, and support data-driven decisions. The aim is to perform data cleaning, exploration, and deep analysis to answer key business questions related to customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

🎯 Objectives
. Clean raw transactional data for consistency and accuracy.

. Explore and summarize the sales data to identify patterns.

. Answer real-world business questions using advanced SQL queries.

. Demonstrate SQL proficiency across data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
PostgreSQL using pgAdmin 4

1-SQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and analysis

2-Structured Query Language (SQL) concepts:

3-CREATE TABLE, SELECT, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, JOIN, CTE, RANK, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, and AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

🧹 Step 1: Data Preparation
. Created a table retail_sales with relevant fields (transactions, customers, product info, prices, etc.).

. Identified and removed records with NULL values in critical columns using DELETE.

. Checked data types and ensured consistency for further analysis.

🔍 Step 2: Data Exploration
. Determined the total number of transactions and unique customers.

. Extracted distinct product categories for segmentation.

. Analyzed missing values before deleting records to maintain data quality.

📊 Step 3: Business Questions & SQL Analysis
. A total of 12 real-world business questions were answered using optimized SQL queries, including:

. Fetching transactions on a specific date.

. Filtering sales by category, quantity, and month.

. Calculating total and average sales per category and month.

. Identifying top-performing months and top 5 customers.

. Segmenting transactions by time-based shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).

. Aggregating customer demographics (e.g., average age).

. Counting unique customers per category.

. Finding daily sales volume and high-value transactions.

. Ranking months by performance using window functions.

. Using HAVING to filter groups (e.g., days with >5 transactions).

✅ Final Outcomes
. Gained hands-on experience with SQL for real-world business analytics.

. Applied data wrangling, aggregation, and window functions to support decision-making.

. Delivered clean, structured, and well-analyzed results that can support sales strategy and customer insights.
